# Welcome to CedarNote

This is your personal markdown knowledge base.

---

## How to Use
- After logging in, click "create note" to make your first note.
- Your new note will need a file name and a location. By default all notes are created in your "root" directory.
- On the left hand side of the screen is the "editor". This is where you will enter all of your notes
    - The "title" field in the editor Allows you to create a friendlier version of the note rather than the file name.
    - Tags and Categories allow you to enter additional information to help you find notes and organize your information.
- The first "#" Symbol is how markdown formats your note. This by default is a large header
    - Go ahead and make this first note perhaps "# This is my first note"
